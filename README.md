# ZoomChatTranscriptParser
A text parser built in python for our Analysis of Algorithms group project.
It analyses the chat transcript of a Zoom meeting and assigns a participation grade to students based on messages sent in the chat.
The message validation is limited to just checking a minimum character count based on the time frame for the project completion.
